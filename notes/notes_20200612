[In order to use ready-made css styles]
semantic-ui.com
    has default css styling files that we can use for free
    when we install semantic ui, don't follow the directions, because it's complicated.
    just Google 'semantic ui cdn'
    go the site and look for https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.4.1/semantic.min.css
    then link the css in index.html under head with <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.4.1/semantic.min.css">



[In order to use randomly generated fake data]
just Google faker js
    generate massive amounts of realistic fake data in Node.js and the browser
    useful when developing something without real data
    import faker from 'faker';
    then {faker.image.avatar()} in JSX
