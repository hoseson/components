We only looked at function-based components up till now,
but now we'll also start to look at class-based components and event handling.
Use functional components for simple content
Use class components for anything else



[Benefits of class components]
Easier code organization
Can use 'state' (another React system) -> Easier to handle user input
Understand lifecycle events -> Easier to do things when the app first starts



[Making the UI change according to user location and current month]
Challenges
1. Need to get the user's physical location
2. Need to determine the current month
3. Need to change text and styling based on location + month
